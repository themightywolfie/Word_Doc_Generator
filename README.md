# Word_Doc_Generator
Students in engineering are required to create a docx file for all the practicals they perform in labs. The most annoying and tedious task is to format the data. To save time, I created a Python program to generate a docx file with predefined formatting.

# Libraries required to run this program
1. docx2pdf - pip install docx2pdf
2. python-docx - pip install python-docx

3. tkinter - pip install tk

# Predfined Styles in the Program
1. Heading - Times New Roman, 16, Bold
2. Sub-Heading - Times New Roman, 14, Bold
3. Content - Times New Roman, 12
4. Header and Footer - Times New Roman, 12, Bold
